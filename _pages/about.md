I am currently a Ph.D. student in computational intelligence at [USI](http://inf.usi.ch) (Lugano, Switzerland) under the supervision of Prof. [Cesare Alippi](http://home.deib.polimi.it/alippi/) (USI) and Prof. [Lorenzo Livi](https://sites.google.com/site/lorenzlivi/) (Univ. of Manitoba, Canada).

My [research]({{ "/research" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) deals with graph processing, learning in non-stationary environment, concept drift and anomaly detection. 

I received B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics at [UNIMI](http://unimi.it) (Milan, Italy). 
In my spare time, I love to play any game and sport and I am a hobbyist woodworker.
