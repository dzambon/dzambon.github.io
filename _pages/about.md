## Short bio

I am a Ph.D. student in computational intelligence and machine learning at [USI](http://inf.usi.ch){:target="_blank"} (Lugano, Switzerland) under the supervision of Prof. [Cesare Alippi](http://home.deib.polimi.it/alippi/){:target="_blank"} (USI) and Prof. [Lorenzo Livi](https://sites.google.com/site/lorenzlivi/){:target="_blank"} (Univ. of Manitoba, Canada).

I received Bachelor's and Master's degrees in mathematics at [UNIMI](http://unimi.it){:target="_blank"} (Milan, Italy) focusing on approximation theory and mathematical statistics. I developed my master thesis in [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com){:target="_blank"} on sparse models for anomaly detection.

In my spare time, I love to play any game and sport and I am a hobbyist woodworker.

## Research

My research deals with the design of methodologies and methods to monitor stochastic processes generating sequences of structured data, like graphs.

I mostly focus on theoretical aspects regarding
- processing of generic attributed graphs, including those with variable topology and order,
- statistical tests for anomaly and concept drift detection,
- representation learning for attributed graph, and
- learning in non-stationary environments.

I work in the [ALPSFORT](https://search.usi.ch/en/projects/947/alpsfort-a-learning-graph-based-framework-for-cyber-physical-systems){:target="_blank"} project, undertaking the development of machine learning methodologies to monitor over time the behaviour of cyber-physical systems, like sensor networks, smart grids, industry 4.0, body and brain network.

A list of my publications is available [here]({{ base_url }}/publications/).
