## Short bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence ([IDSIA](https://www.idsia.usi-supsi.ch/)), affiliated with Universit√† della Svizzera italiana ([USI](http://inf.usi.ch)) in Switzerland <span class="fi fi-ch"></span>. I am member of the [IEEE Task Force on Learning for Graphs](https://www.learning4graphs.org) and the [Graph Machine Learning Group](https://gmlg.ch) in Lugano.

I earned my Ph.D. in Informatics from [USI](http://inf.usi.ch) <span class="fi fi-ch"></span> (Jan '22), focusing on statistical tests for anomaly and change detection, graph representation learning, and learning in non-stationary environments. Prior to my PhD, I graduated with honors from the [University of Milan](http://www.matematica.unimi.it/ecm/home) <span class="fi fi-it"></span> (IT, Apr '16) with a degree in Mathematics specializing in approximation theory and mathematical statistics. During my doctoral studies, I have been visiting researcher at the [University of Florida](http://www.cnel.ufl.edu/) <span class="fi fi-us"></span> (US, Nov '19--Feb '20) working on kernel adaptive methods and at the [University of Exeter](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/) <span class="fi fi-gb"></span> (UK, Sep '17, Oct '18) exploring embeddings onto Riemannian manifolds. I have also been an intern at [STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com) <span class="fi fi-it"></span> (IT, May '15--Apr '16, May '16--Sep '16) where I developed my Master's thesis on sparse models for anomaly detection and co-authored a patent. 

My work has been published in top-tier journals and conferences of the field, including JMLR, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TSP, NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML. I am associate editor for IEEE TNNLS. I hold a patent. I have co-organized special sessions and tutorials at international conferences on graph deep learning.
