* Working on a **survey** on GNN architectures for time series analysis: check out our preprint [GNN4TS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19183)
* Our **tutorial** on [graph deep learning for time-series processing](https://gmlg.ch/tutorials/graph-based-processing/ecml-2023) has been accepted at [ECML PKDD 2023](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/)!
* I've become **member** of the [IEEE Task Force on Learning for Graphs](https://www.learning4graphs.org/).
* A bunch of **preprints** on arXiv about: Kalman filters [[1](#alippi2023graph)], spatio-temporal models [[2](#zambon2023graph), [3](#cini2022sparse), [4](#cini2023taming)], and model optimality [[5](#zambon2023where)].
* Our **special sessions** on [DL4G @ IEEE IJCNN 2023](https://2023.ijcnn.org/paper-submission/special-sessions#session-4-37) and [GRL @ ESANN 2023](https://www.esann.org/special-sessions#session4) will be held soon in Gold Coast (Queensland, AU) and Bruges (BE).
* Paper accepted @ **NeurIPS '22**. [AZ-whiteness test](#zambon2022aztest): with it you can test the optimality of GNN's.
* We got **funded** by [OCRE](https://www.ocre-project.eu/news-insights/news/ocre-awards-cloud-adoption-funding-15-exciting-research-projects?utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=15-projects-funded) with cloud computing resources for a project in collaboration with [UniPD](https://www.unipd.it/).
