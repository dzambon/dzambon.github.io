{% include base_path %}

Main features are:

- Multivariate statistical tests for change and anomaly detection [[1]({{ base_path }}/publications/zambon2018concept), [2]({{ base_path }}/publications/zambon2018change)];
- Embedding techniques for graphs, including those on Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature [[3]({{ base_path }}/publications/zambon2018anomaly)];
- A wrapper to perform repeated experiments and report performance measures;

Any contribution to the project is very welcome.
