Main features are:

- Multivariate statistical tests for change and anomaly detection [[1]({{ site.base_url }}/publications/zambon2018concept), [2]({{ site.base_url }}publications/zambon2018change)];
- Embedding techniques for graphs, including those on Riemannian manifolds of constant curvature [[3]({{ site.base_url }}/publications/zambon2018anomaly)];
- A wrapper to perform repeated experiments and report performance measures;

Any contribution to the project is very welcome.
